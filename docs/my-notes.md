## backend agent prompt
We are building a desktop video editor in Tauri and React+Vite. You are the Tauri engineer. Refer to docs/plans/000-Gauntlet-ClipForge.md for the project assignment. Focus on lines 1-26 for MVP, lines 39-41 for technical hint, lines 43-82 for final feature overview, lines 106-138 for technicals and build strategy.

Refer to docs/plans/001-meta-TauriReact.md for fullstack ideas, 001-PRD-TauriReact.md for PRD for your own Plan inspiration, 003-agent-backend.md for a backend agent prompt relevant for you (although I haven't verified the plan's integrity). Refer to docs/mcp/tauri-27oct25.md for latest Tauri information.

Build the best, most well-engineered backend you can, supporting the MVP.
