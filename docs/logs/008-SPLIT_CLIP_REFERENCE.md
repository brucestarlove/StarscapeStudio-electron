## Requirements for Splitting

âœ… A clip must be selected (or will auto-select on right-click)
âœ… The playhead must be **inside** the clip bounds (not at edges)
âœ… Cannot split if playhead is outside the selected clip

## What Happens After Split

The selected clip becomes two clips:
- **First clip:** Original start to playhead position
- **Second clip:** Playhead position to original end
- Both clips retain their asset references and effects
- Both clips are placed consecutively on the same track
