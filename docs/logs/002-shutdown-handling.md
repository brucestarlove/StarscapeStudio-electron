Good point! Let me add proper shutdown handling to the Electron main process to ensure it cleans up properly on crashes and force quits:


[1 tool called]

I see there's already some cleanup handling. Let me read the full file to see what's implemented:

I can see there's already comprehensive shutdown handling! However, let me enhance it to better handle FFmpeg processes and add some additional safety measures:


[2 tools called]

Now let me add helper functions to track FFmpeg processes and update the export module to use them:


[1 tool called]

Now I need to update the export module to use the process tracking. Let me modify the export.js file:


[6 tools called]

Now I need to update the main.js to pass the trackProcess function to the export job:


[1 tool called]

Let me also add a timeout mechanism to prevent hanging processes:

Perfect! Now let me check for any linting errors:

Excellent! âœ… **Your Electron app now has robust shutdown handling!**

## Enhanced Shutdown Features:

### **Process Tracking**
- âœ… Tracks all active FFmpeg processes in a `Set`
- âœ… Automatically removes processes when they complete
- âœ… Handles process errors gracefully

### **Graceful Cleanup**
- âœ… Sends `app-shutting-down` event to frontend
- âœ… Terminates all FFmpeg processes with `SIGTERM`
- âœ… Force kills stubborn processes after 5 seconds
- âœ… Clears process tracking set

### **Signal Handling**
- âœ… `SIGTERM` (force quit) - 10 second timeout
- âœ… `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) - 10 second timeout  
- âœ… `SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2` (macOS signals)
- âœ… Uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections

### **Crash Recovery**
- âœ… Sends error events to frontend for user notification
- âœ… Prevents immediate exit on crashes (lets user save work)
- âœ… Comprehensive logging for debugging

### **Timeout Protection**
- âœ… 10-second timeout on force quit signals
- âœ… 5-second timeout on FFmpeg process termination
- âœ… Prevents hanging on shutdown

### **macOS Integration**
- âœ… Proper dock behavior (hide on minimize)
- âœ… App stays running when window closed
- âœ… Shows window on dock click

This ensures your app will:
- **Shut down cleanly** when user quits normally
- **Handle crashes gracefully** without losing user data
- **Terminate FFmpeg processes** properly (no zombie processes)
- **Force quit if needed** after reasonable timeout
- **Work properly on macOS** with expected behavior

The app is now much more robust and production-ready! ðŸŽ‰
