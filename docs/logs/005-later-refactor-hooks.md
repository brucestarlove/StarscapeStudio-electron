Absolutely! Let me analyze what you have vs. what's required:

## Feature Completeness Check (Lines 54-96)

### **Timeline Editor** ‚úÖ (You have this!)
- ‚úÖ Visual timeline with playhead
- ‚úÖ Drag clips onto timeline (working now after the fix!)
- ‚úÖ Arrange clips in sequence
- ‚úÖ Trim clips (ClipView has trim handles)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Split clips at playhead (in store but needs UI)
- ‚úÖ Delete clips from timeline (Delete key works!)
- ‚úÖ Multiple tracks (now have Video Track 1, Video Track 2, Audio Track 1)
- ‚úÖ Zoom in/out on timeline
- ‚úÖ Snap-to-grid/edges (snapEnabled in playbackStore)

### **Preview & Playback** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Real-time preview (Stage.tsx)
- ‚úÖ Play/pause controls (TransportControls)
- ‚úÖ Scrubbing (Playhead dragging)
- ‚úÖ Audio playback synchronized (AudioManager)
- ‚úÖ Preview shows current frame

### **Export & Sharing** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Export to MP4 (ExportDialog)
- ‚úÖ Resolution options (in ExportDialog)
- ‚úÖ Progress indicator
- ‚úÖ Save to local filesystem

### **Additional Features** (Partial)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Text overlays - No
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Transitions - No
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio controls (volume) - Have volume in playback store
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Filters/effects - No
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Export presets - No
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keyboard shortcuts - Have Delete key!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-save - No
- ‚ùå Undo/redo - No (stretch goal, ignore)

## **Custom Hooks (Option 3) is PERFECT for Your Current Stage**

Here's why **Option 3 is sufficient**:

### 1. **You're in Core Feature Completion Mode**
You need to finish:
- Split UI (add button near playhead)
- Maybe add a few more keyboard shortcuts
- Polish existing features

**Custom hooks won't slow you down** and give you flexibility to iterate.

### 2. **Your Side Effect Footprint is Small**
Currently you only have:
- ‚úÖ Audio sync (AudioManager)
- Maybe later: Canvas effects (CanvasEffects.ts exists)

That's **2 side effects total**. Not worth middleware overhead.

### 3. **Middleware Adds Complexity You Don't Need**
For your 72-hour timeline:
- ‚ùå Middleware = 30 mins to implement + testing + debugging
- ‚úÖ Custom hooks = 15 mins to implement + clearer for rapid changes
- ‚úÖ Current approach = 0 mins, working NOW

### 4. **You're Building an MVP, Not Enterprise Software**
The requirements say:
> "A simple, working video editor that can record, arrange clips, and export beats a feature-rich app that crashes"

**Your current architecture is working!** Don't over-engineer.

---

## **My Concrete Recommendation**

### **Keep Current Approach** (Store + audioManager)

**Reasoning:**
1. ‚úÖ **It works** - Audio cleanup is now handled
2. ‚úÖ **Clear and debuggable** - Easy to trace what's happening
3. ‚úÖ **Fast to modify** - No abstraction layers to change
4. ‚úÖ **Sufficient for MVP** - Handles your side effects

### **When to Refactor to Custom Hooks:**
Only if you add **3+ more side effects**, like:
- Canvas node auto-creation/cleanup
- Auto-save on every change
- Undo/redo state tracking
- Analytics/logging
- Cloud sync

### **When to Consider Middleware:**
Only if you're building a **commercial product post-Gauntlet** and need:
- Complex undo/redo
- Time-travel debugging
- Multi-user collaboration
- Extensive plugin system

---

## **Focus on What's Missing**

Instead of refactoring architecture, focus on completing core features:

### **High Priority (Core Features)**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Split clip UI** - Add split button or keyboard shortcut (store has `splitClip()`)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Recording features** (lines 30-37) - If you haven't implemented yet
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Import improvements** - Drag & drop, thumbnails

### **Medium Priority (Polish)**
4. More keyboard shortcuts (Space = play/pause, J/K/L = playback)
5. Better clip selection (multi-select with Shift/Cmd)
6. Timeline markers/labels

### **Low Priority (Stretch Goals)**
7. Text overlays
8. Transitions
9. Filters

---

## **My Final Answer**

**YES, your current architecture is sufficient!**

Don't refactor. Your time is better spent:
1. ‚úÖ Finishing missing features (split, recording if needed)
2. ‚úÖ Testing export with multiple clips
3. ‚úÖ Building and packaging the app
4. ‚úÖ Testing on real hardware

**The best architecture is the one that lets you ship.** You're 80% done with core features. Stay the course! üöÄ

**Action items for next 24 hours:**
1. ‚úÖ Keep current store + audioManager approach
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Add split clip UI (1 hour)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Test full export pipeline (2 hours)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Package and test build (3 hours)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Polish UI/UX (remaining time)

Want me to help you implement split clip UI or any other missing features instead?
