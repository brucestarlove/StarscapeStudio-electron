## ✅ Image Support Complete!

**What works now:**

1. **Image Playback** 🎬
   - Images appear on the stage/preview canvas
   - Rendered using cached `HTMLImageElement` for efficiency
   - Work seamlessly with videos on the timeline

2. **Default Duration** ⏱️
   - Images default to **5 seconds** when added
   - Can be adjusted from **250ms minimum** to **60 seconds maximum**
   - Drag the trim handles (left/right edges) to extend or shorten

3. **Smart Insertion** 🎯
   - Images use the same collision detection as videos
   - No overlapping clips
   - Automatically shifts clips when needed
   - Drop left/right of existing clips works perfectly

4. **Export Support** 📤
   - Images are converted to video segments using FFmpeg
   - Uses `-loop 1 -framerate 30` to create smooth video from still images
   - Respects duration and resolution settings
   - Seamlessly concatenates with video clips

5. **Duration Constraints**
   - Minimum: 250ms (prevents too-short flashes)
   - Default: 5 seconds (good for most use cases)
   - Maximum: 60 seconds (ready for Ken Burns effects later!)

**Try it out:**
- Drag an image to the timeline
- Grab the right trim handle and extend it
- Play through it - the image should display perfectly
- Mix images and videos on the same track
- Export a project with images and verify the output!

The image support is now feature-complete and matches professional video editor behavior! 🎉
