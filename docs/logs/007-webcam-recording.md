All todos have been completed. Here's what was implemented:

### Features Added:

2. **Device Enumeration** - Lists all available cameras and microphones (mic UI ready but not functional per requirements)
3. **Live Preview** - Shows camera feed before and during recording
4. **MediaRecorder Integration** - Records WebM video at 1280x720 @ 30fps
5. **File Handling** - Automatically converts WebM to MP4 and saves to cache
6. **Success Modal** - Matches screen recording flow with Import/Reveal buttons
7. **UtilitiesPane Integration** - Enabled "Record Webcam" button

### Files Modified:

- `/electron/main.js` (fixed blob save handler)
