## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Core Features Implemented:

1. **Main Track Visual Indicator** (`TrackHeader.tsx`)
   - Added "MAIN" badge to Track 1 with gradient styling
   - Clearly identifies Track 1 as the main full-screen track

2. **Smart CanvasNode Initialization** (`projectStore.ts`)
   - Track 1 clips: Full canvas size (1920x1080) at position (0, 0)
   - Track 2+ clips: PiP size (480x270) at bottom-right (1440, 810)
   - Split clips inherit transform properties from parent

3. **Advanced Canvas Rendering** (`CanvasCompositor.ts`)
   - Track 1: Full-screen rendering (no transforms)
   - Track 2+: PiP rendering with transforms (position, size, rotation, opacity)
   - Proper save/restore of canvas state
   - Separate rendering methods for main and transformed clips

4. **CanvasNode Data Flow** (`Stage.tsx`)
   - Wired canvasNodes from store through to compositor
   - Updated helper functions to include canvasNode data
   - Tracks canvas display dimensions for transform controls

5. **Interactive Transform Controls** (`TransformControls.tsx`)
   - **Drag to move**: Click and drag PiP clips anywhere on canvas
   - **Resize handles**: 4 corner handles (hold Shift for aspect ratio lock)
   - **Rotation handle**: Purple handle at top for rotation
   - Visual feedback with selection highlighting
   - Coordinate transformation from canvas space to display space
   - Only affects Track 2+ clips (PiP), not main track

6. **Transform Controls Integration** (`Stage.tsx`)
   - Overlay positioned absolutely over canvas
   - Resize observer tracks canvas dimensions
   - Real-time transform updates to store

7. **Export with PiP Support** (`ExportDialog.tsx`, `editPlan.js`, `export.js`)
   - **ExportDialog**: Includes canvasNodes in export data, proper track role assignment
   - **editPlan.js**: Processes canvasNodes and attaches transform data to overlay clips
   - **export.js**: FFmpeg complex filter chains for compositing
     - Scale filter for resizing overlays
     - Overlay filter with position coordinates
     - Time-based enabling for overlay visibility
     - Handles multiple overlays per segment

### How to Use:

1. **Add clips to tracks**:
   - Track 1 (Main): Full-screen video/images
   - Track 2+: PiP overlays

2. **Transform PiP clips in Stage**:
   - Click to select a PiP clip
   - Drag the bounding box to move
   - Drag corner handles to resize (Shift = maintain aspect ratio)
   - Drag the purple handle at top to rotate

3. **Export**:
   - PiP transforms are preserved in export
   - FFmpeg composites overlays onto main track
   - Multiple overlays are supported

### Technical Details:

- **Canvas space**: 1920x1080 (top-left origin)
- **Default PiP**: 480x270 (25% size) at (1440, 810) - bottom-right
- **Transform order**: Translate → Rotate → Scale
- **Export**: Uses FFmpeg complex filters with scale and overlay
